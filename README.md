# GWAS_Premature_Stop_Codons
### Summary of the Study
Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) are methods of associating genetic variations with phenotypes that have gained popularity in the last two decades. The GWAS began with human research to identify risk genes that could cause diseases. Later it was also used as a method of obtaining more economically efficient and yielding plant species due to the increasing population. Another application of GWAS is to comprehend the evolutionary significance of natural variations in species. Arabidopsis thaliana plays an important role as model plant in evolution, and the effect of genetic variations on evolutionary genomics was investigated using mutations identified through GWAS in this study.
Various mutations occur in all living organisms. Among these mutations, the premature stop codon (nonsense mutations) is a dangerous mutation and causes protein truncation. Previous research showed that over co-occurrence gene pairs were formed as a result of premature stop codons in the same A. thaliana accessions. It was hypothesized that there is a regulatory genes effect on the formation of the premature stop codons in the same accessions. These regulatory genes called as trans genes in this thesis. A total of 1128 A. thaliana significant over co-occurrence gene pairs from 1135 accessions were used in this study and, 32 significant regulatory genes (trans genes) that played a role in the formation of these associations were identified. The over co-occurrence gene pairs cause the formation of 32 trans genes and these trans genes are shown in the same gene network, allowing the interactions of trans genes on over co-occurrence gene pairs to be explored in greater depth. Permutation based GWAS was used in accordance with the threshold used for the non-normally distributed phenotype in the GWAS results. However, both the Manhattan plots and the Quantile-Quantile plots detected more false positive SNPs than expected. It was attempted to determine causal variants from the GWAS results and the importance of the respective genes in the formation of the premature stop codon. However, detection of causal variants and the identification of SNPs that can cause premature stop codon formation proved to be very difficult. The factors that will cause this situation are still being researched and alternative methods are being sought to eliminate the causes of false positive SNPs.
In conclusion, the AT2G21830, AT1G08840, and AT2G18735 genes were identified as important regulatory genes in the study. It aims to demonstrate the impact of these important regulatory genes on the formation of premature stop codons in the same accessions, with future validation tests.
